# Web-Ad-Scraping-to-Speech
The project is an assignment for a full-stack internship at a start-up. It is a simple web page where users can input a keyword (e.g., "iPhone" or "buy iPhone"). The application will then scrape the Google search result page to identify the first shopping ad related to that keyword and display its details. The scraped information should then be converted into an audio file using text-to-speech technology and played back to the user.
